# HackerRank Challenges Solution

This repository was created to serve as a marker of the path I took while learning the Elixir programming language.

All challenges performed here were selected on the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) website and each respective solution will be linked to the direct description on the website.

The solutions will be developed using TDD and the best practices that I know at the time of their resolution (the practices applied during development may not be the best possible within the ideal of the language, being subject to future improvements or divergences).

The folder pattern defined by the `mix` tool will be used, where the solutions will be in the `lib/` folder and the tests in the `test/` folder, where each solution will be executed within the file itself and with its own module.

To learn more about the Elixir language visit the website [elixir-lang](https://elixir-lang.org/). To start learning about Elixir I recommend this page [elixirschool](https://elixirschool.com/).

## Running

First, download the repository to your machine with the command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/matheusma37/hackerrank_challenges_solution.git
```

Enter the folder with the cloned project, using the command:
```
$ cd hackerrank_challenges_solution/
```

To download possible project dependencies, run:
```
$ mix deps.get
```

For the previous step it is necessary to have the `Hex` package manager installed. If you don't have it, you will be asked if you want to install it, type `Y` and press `Enter`. Now just wait for the dependencies to be installed.

Finally, to run the tests, do:
```
$ mix test
```
